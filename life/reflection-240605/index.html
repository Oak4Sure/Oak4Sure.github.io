<p>I arrived at the Zhuhai campus and managed to find the BnB I had booked. Since I didn't add the host on WeChat, I initially went to the wrong location. It was raining, and I felt really exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="1430-1830"><a href="#1430-1830" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:1430-1830" class="headings">14:30-18:30</a></h3>
<p>I rested at the BnB and spent some time writing blog entries.</p>
<h3 id="1840-2100"><a href="#1840-2100" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:1840-2100" class="headings">18:40-21:00</a></h3>
<p>I went out for dinner but couldn't find anything both cheap and delicious. Before coming here, people online mentioned that seafood in Zhuhai is affordable, but that didn't seem to be the case. I wandered around and finally ended up at a Guilin noodle shop, which can be found anywhere. It was a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>After dinner, I walked along the seacoast and really enjoyed myself. I went to the beach outside the Zhuhai campus, but it was full of garbage and not as beautiful as I had imagined. Unfortunately, my shoes rubbed my feet raw from walking such a long distance. I then rode a shared bike back to the BnB. On my way back, I explored the food around the campus and bought a grilled chicken leg.</p>
<h3 id="whatever"><a href="#whatever" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:whatever" class="headings">Whatever</a></h3>
<p>This travel plan was completely spontaneous. It took only about 15 minutes from deciding to buy a ticket to actually purchasing one. I love this feeling: whenever you want to go, you just go. One day I was still studying in the library with my old dorm mates, and the next day I found myself in Zhuhai with a bag on my back.</p>
<p>After a long period of preparing for my summer internship interviews, filled with ups and downs, acceptances and rejections, I finally passed Huawei's interview and did quite well. However, as of the day I’m writing this blog, I still haven't received the official offer. The HR told me not to worry because the interviewers were very satisfied with my performance. So, since there's nothing more I can do right now, why not treat myself to a short trip instead of sitting in the library, reluctantly working on something slowly?</p>
<p>The thing I wanted to see most was the sea. I've only seen the sea twice, including this trip. I love the feeling of being embraced by the sea. It helps me deal with troubles, frustrations, and sadness. As soon as you look at the sea, nothing else seems to matter. The vastness and the endless horizon create a sense of peace and insignificance that is incredibly liberating. As I walked along the coastline, I was so happy that I couldn't help but hum a song. The gentle sound of the waves, the salty breeze made me feel so free and content. It was a perfect moment of tranquility and joy.</p>
<p>Before this trip, people online said Zhuhai is a slow-paced city, so don't rush, just enjoy it. I completely agree. The laid-back atmosphere was a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of my daily life. I strolled through the city, exploring its quiet streets, enjoying local food, and simply soaking in the relaxed vibe. The slower pace allowed me to truly savor each moment and appreciate the beauty around me.</p>
<p>But after the happiness and freedom, loneliness set in. Previously, I enjoyed solitude 80% of the time and felt lonely 20% of the time, but now it feels more like 50-50. Despite the beautiful surroundings and the joy of exploration, I couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. Walking alone on the beach, seeing other people with their friends and loved ones, made me acutely aware of my own solitude. It's a strange feeling — enjoying the freedom of being alone but also yearning for companionship.</p>
<p>Both joy and loneliness are just waves that come and go. I don't want to be casual and just find a random girl to kill the loneliness. It's easy, but it's not responsible, for either me or her. Instead, I want to find someone who truly connects with me, someone who understands and shares my experiences. So, I'll let time provide the answer. Until then, I'll continue to enjoy my own company and the beauty of the world around me, trusting that everything will fall into place when the time is right.</p>
<p>Especially the offical offer from Huawei, I hope it come soon.🤣😘</p>

<h3 id="1200"><a href="#1200" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:1200" class="headings">12:00</a></h3>
<p>I got up and realized I had forgotten my umbrella in the shared bike’s basket. Luckily, it was a cloudy day, and it didn’t rain. The cool breeze was refreshing.</p>
<h3 id="1300"><a href="#1300" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:1300" class="headings">13:00</a></h3>
<p>I decided to have Chongqing hot-pot for lunch by myself. On my way to the restaurant, I found a buffet that caught my eye, so I changed my plan and went there instead. The buffet had red wine, which surprised me the most. I've only had red wine a few times, the last being during Chinese New Year, and I had already forgotten what it tasted like. They also had oysters, crabs, and fresh beef. This was my first time having lunch alone in a big canteen. It wasn’t bad, and I felt it was a big step for me. I was still a bit uncomfortable, like wanting to take photos of the food to send to friends but feeling too shy to raise my phone. Overall, I managed well.</p>
<h3 id="1430"><a href="#1430" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:1430" class="headings">14:30</a></h3>
<p>I set out to visit some well-known spots and planned to take photos. I mostly wanted to take selfies. I used to be too shy to take selfies. Gradually I started taking selfies with close friends. This time, I wanted to do it alone. The spots were along the coastline, so I planned to walk from one to another. The main reason I didn't take a bus or bike was that I wasn't familiar with the traffic rules here and wasn’t sure which bus to take. Walking seemed the simplest option. During my walk, I tried to take some selfies, but I'm not good at it. My smiles looked weird and ugly 🤣, and I struggled to find good angles. So, the next step is practicing selfies and working on a nice smile.</p>
<h3 id="1900"><a href="#1900" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:1900" class="headings">19:00</a></h3>
<p>I went back to the hotel and rested. I was really exhausted from walking such a long distance. Remembering that I hadn’t tried the seafood in Zhuhai yet, I decided to order takeout. I ordered stir-fried bullfrog and grilled oysters. Both tasted so good and the portions were generous. I almost couldn’t finish them.</p>
<h2 id="whatever-1"><a href="#whatever-1" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:whatever-1" class="headings">Whatever</a></h2>
<p>I posted 6 pictures on my WeChat Moments. The first and second ones are of a Shiba Inu crossing the road with its owner. The third is of a man standing on a big rock by the sea, fishing. The fourth is of a Corgi with its owner, who is a park cleaner collecting garbage at the scenic spot. The fifth is of a family of three riding shared bikes along a seaside road. The last one is a sign that says &quot;Stay Out of Water&quot; in Chinese, &quot;禁止下海.&quot; I think it's funny.</p>
<p><strong>These pictures actually represent the future I aspire to have: a dog, a loving family to stay with, and the freedom to spend an afternoon fishing and enjoying my own time.</strong></p>
<p>However, I am so far from it. Move forward, man.</p>
<h2 id="some-problems"><a href="#some-problems" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:some-problems" class="headings">Some Problems</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>如果住宿只预定一个晚上的话，意味着第一天你需要到14:00才能进住宿放东西，然后才能去玩，第二天你不能赖床12：00就得check out. 然后带着一堆东西去下一个住宿放，在check out和next check in之间吃午饭得拖着一堆东西。</p>
<p><strong>所以下次订酒店就选好一个地方，订多天。</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>感觉自己找的吃的地方，或者说上高德和美团上找的地方不是很满意，很贵。</p>
<p><strong>那个自助是再去火锅店路上遇到的，反而体验很好。所以下次可能对于吃的东西这种要提前上小红书上看看有什么想吃的？</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="68-after珠海"><a href="#68-after珠海" class="anchor-link">#</a><a href="#contents:68-after珠海" class="headings">6.8 After珠海</a></h2>
<p>今天从珠海回来，在宿舍群发了<strong>桃园一场，余生随往，孩子们我回来了</strong>，过了5个小时，一个舍友回复了一个表情，另外一个舍友接着回复了另一个表情，就这样。</p>
<p>晚上八点，一个“朋友”问我<strong>回来了吗，老公</strong>，然后跑下来找我聊天。他的腾讯面试过了很高兴，之所以找我是因为他认识的其他人，比如说在国外留学的进腾讯很容易，跟他们聊他们也不是很在乎，还比如说他的舍友跟他的路线不同，体会不到。那他跟我聊就可能比较有成就感，他一直跟我说他有多开心多开心，我确实也是为他开心的，但是讨厌这种被利用的感觉。</p>
